    "## If you're new to this: Creating a Minimalist Website with Hugo and Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preamble: A quick intro to Git\n",
    "[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is an essential tool for anyone who works with data or code. It makes it easy to keep various versions of your code, and to collaborate on code with other people ny hosting code on, for example, [github](https://github.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we will also rely on github for hosting our website, it's a good idea to go through a brief introduction to git and github in case you're not familiar with them: [this tutorial should provide a good first exposure.](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hugo\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a framework for quickly creating beautiful websites using nothing more than the Markdown you are used to from Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going further, make a new directory, navigate to it in a terminal (for whose of you using windows, you should ~~stop using windows~~ use [git-bash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash)), and turn it into a git repository by running: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git init\n",
    "git branch -M main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Within that directory, go through Hugo's quick-start tutorial [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/). Pick a nice theme, and play around with your website (add some text, try some of the formatting options, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are done, commit your changes: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git add --all\n",
    "git commit -m \"Some message detailing what you did\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hosting your website on Github Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) offers an easy way to host your static websites directly on github. We'll do  that with the basic website we just created. You can find some information on how to do this [here](https://bwaycer.github.io/hugo_tutorial.hugo/tutorials/github-pages-blog/): we'll detail the first alternative from that tutorial, but if you're comfortable with git, we suggest trying the second alternative as it is more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initialize a new github repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to github and create a [new repository](https://github.com/new). On the next page, follow the instructions under \"â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line\", and push the repository containing your Hugo website. Follow the instructions on the tutorial above ([this one](https://bwaycer.github.io/hugo_tutorial.hugo/tutorials/github-pages-blog/)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Setup github pages for your repository\n",
    "- Change hugo's configuration so that the build directory is \"docs\"\n",
    "- Re-build your website\n",
    "- Commit/push your changes, and check that you can see the website on github. \n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, mine is [here](https://ldorigo.github.io/dataviz_website_demo/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: you might have to change Hugo's configuration (`config.toml`) so that `base_url` points to the url of your page. So in my case:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "baseURL = \"https://ldorigo.github.io/dataviz_website_demo\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Adding some visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "You now (should) have a website, but it's kind of empty. Let's populate it with a few different visualizations from previous weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple matplotlib figures\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is easy, as it just exports plain images that you can include in your website. Choose a nice visualization form one of the previous weeks, save it to a file (hint: look into `pyplot.savefig`), and add it to a page on your website (see [here](https://www.austinfriday.com/tutorial/adding-images-to-your-hugo-pages/) for a simple walkthrough).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** because we are taking the easy road and building our website in the docs folder, you'll probably have an issue when viewing the images once your site is online. See [here](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/can-i-reference-baseurl-from-content/2686/2) for a fix:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a file  `your_website_folder/layouts/shortcodes/baseurl.html` (you might have to create the `shortcodes` folder)\n",
    "* Put the following line in that file: `{{ .Page.Site.BaseURL }}`\n",
    "* You can then reference images in your markdown file as follows: `![image description]({{< baseurl >}}/image.png)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, you can see my (very elaborate) page for an example of how it should look [here](https://ldorigo.github.io/dataviz_website_demo/pages/matplotlib/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bokeh Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to put static images, let's notch it up a little bit and add those fantastic interactive plots from the previous exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, see [here](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/embed.html) for how to export bokeh plots as html. \n",
    "If you open the resulting html file in a text editor, you should see there's two parts: a `<head> ... </head>`, where the bokeh library is loaded, and a `<body> ... </body>`, where the plots are rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to include those plots into a new hugo page is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a blank markdown page\n",
    "* At the beginning of the page, copy-paste the two `<script>`s that are in the `<head>` of your html file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdn.bokeh.org/bokeh/release/bokeh-2.3.0.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-HjagQp6T0/7bxYTAXbLotF1MLAGWmhkY5siA1Gc/pcEgvgRPtMsRn0gQtMwGKiw1\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n",
    "<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n",
    "     Bokeh.set_log_level(\"info\");\n",
    "</script>\n",
    "```    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Where you want your plots to appear, copy-pase everything that's inside the `<body>` of your html file\n",
    "* To allow rendering html, you need to add the following two lines to your hugo configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[markup.goldmark.renderer]\n",
    "    unsafe = true\n",
    "```    \n",
    "\n",
    "You should now be able to see your bokeh plot on your page. If you want to add more plots in the same page, you can repeat the above, but you **don't** need to add what's in the `<head>` again (that is, the `<script>`s in the `<head>` should only be on your page once).\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Note:** _Just pasting all the html on top level isn't exactly coding best practice, but it's easy and it'll do for a small project like this. If you can stomach it, there are better ways, such as the one desribed [here](https://angelov.ai/post/2020/05/interactive-plots-with-bokeh/)._\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "For an example of what the markdown should look like, see [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ldorigo/dataviz_website_demo/main/content/pages/bokeh.md) - and see [here](https://ldorigo.github.io/dataviz_website_demo/pages/bokeh/) for a preview of what it should look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Closing Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Congrats, you can now make a website! We've only scratched the surface, but this should be enough to get started on your projects. Note that we haven't talked about plotly and/or folium, but the process is virtually identical to bokeh: export to html, and include the exported html in your pages.\n",

    "[Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) is an open-source framework made by the same team behind Plotly. It's great for making interactive data visualization web-apps/dashboards. You can take a look at the [gallery](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/Portal/) to get a feel of what it is possible to do with it.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Although it is perfectly possible to add static images (like plots made in matplotlib) or to embed external html (such as a visualization exported from Bokeh), Dash really shines when you use it together with Plotly, as it has a rich interface to generate interactive graphs on-the fly.\n",

    "Last but not least, we need to host our shiny new web-app. Unfortunately, github pages can't run python in the back-end. One solution is to host it on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/): you can do so by following [this tutorial](https://austinlasseter.medium.com/how-to-deploy-a-simple-plotly-dash-app-to-heroku-622a2216eb73). Note that the free version of Heroku is limited to 500Mb of RAM - for small(-ish) datasets, that should be more than enough. If you need more, I can recommend [Pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) as a paid, but cheap, alternative. \n",
